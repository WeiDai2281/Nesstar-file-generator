      <abstract>
        The Adult Survey is administered primarily to 15-49 year old adults, and explores changes the health status of men, women and children living in the Millennium Villages. In addition, the Adult Survey examines wider issues of relevance to this group - including empowerment (for women), literacy, as well as 'social capital and social networks'.

When the Adult Survey is administered to either male or female respondents, a common set of modules are used that explore health seeking behaviour, TB, HIV, sexual behaviour, smoking, alcohol, mental health, literacy, and social capital.

When the Adult Survey is administered to a female respondent, a longer version is used that examines issues such as contraception, birth history, antenatal/prenatal care, the health of under 5's and domestic violence.

          The Adult Survey was administered to all 15-49 year olds in the research households. There are two versions of this questionnaire--one for males and a longer one for females. The Adult Survey asks questions about general health seeking behavior, TB, HIV/AIDS knowledge, sexual behavior, smoking and alcohol use, mental health, literacy, cell phone use, local organizations, coping mechanisms, trust, and collective action.  The female survey additionally includes  information on contraception, birth history, pregnancy and postnatal care, diarrhea and fever in children &lt;5, vaccinations, extension training, empowerment, and domestic violence.

          The Adult Survey training took place in early July 2009 for a period of 1 week. During this period, surveys were repeatedly reviewed for consistency and completeness by field supervisors and data entry clerks. The data collection team was comprised of approximately 20 individuals trained in administering the survey.

        Data were entered in field offices using CSPro 3.3. All data were double entered in verification mode in CSPro and batch cleaned using CSPro cleaning scripts. Details of data processing steps can be found in project documentation, and  data processing programs in CSPro, that are part of the external resources.

All range checks and skips were controlled by the program and operators could not override these. A large set of consistency checks were also included in the data entry program. Structure and completeness checking ensured that all data had been entered and were structurally sound.

Verification of MDG related  variables and other key metrics (such as date or birth or gender) was performed using independent verification, i.e. double entry of data, with two different individuals performing single and double entry. Comparison of data followed by modification.

After completion of all processing in CSPro, files were backed up before concatenating data together using the CSPro file concatenate utility.

For tabulation and analysis Stata versions 10.0 were used.

Millennium Villages Project Data Access Policy

This document describes the data access policy for household survey data, process evaluation qualitative data, and economic costing data collected at 14 villages in Africa designated as 'Millennium Villages' by the Millennium Villages Project (MVP).  It applies to household, community and project -level data that are collected in each of the villages (see Appendix 2 for data collected in Year 1) throughout the five-year project.
MVP classifies the project data covered in this policy into three types:
Type I- 'Sensitive' microlevel household survey data. 'Sensitive data' deal with topics that may be associated with social stigmas, including STI and HIV/AIDS, physical violence and mental health.
Type II -'Non-sensitive' microlevel household survey data. 'Non-sensitive data' are not related to topics that may be associated with social stigmas, and include, for example, general demographic information, household assets, crop yields, and malaria prevalence. Village level entomology, water quality and availability, soil property, vegetation, and biodiversity data also fall into this category.  These data include qualitative data that captures the implementation experiences and practices from all MVP interventions-- for example, attitudes and opinions about the efficacy of the school meals program, agronomic field training, etc. These data also include disaggregated budget, expenditure, and in-kind contribution data from all project stakeholders, including regional and national governments; non-governmental organizations; multi-lateral organizations; private donors; beneficiary community members; and the MVP.
Type III - Aggregated village level indicators and related data, for example, those pertaining to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
The Columbia University IRB protocol includes a list of the Columbia researchers and MVP Project staff who have permission to access the data. Anyone not listed on the existing Columbia MV IRB protocol who wishes to access the data, including Columbia students and individuals not affiliated with Columbia University, must submit a protocol to the Columbia IRB as well as the IRB at their home institution (if applicable). Requests from Columbia faculty and post doctoral fellows to be included on the existing IRB protocol will be considered by the MVP Principal Investigators on a case-by-case basis. The following table lists these four categories of Data Users and the IRB requirements they must meet before obtaining access to Type I and II MVP data.

Data User--IRB requirements:
MVP investigators and assistants listed on IRB protocol--   Pre-approved by IRB
Columbia faculty and postdoctoral fellows-- May be included on MVP IRB protocol at the discretion of the Investigators and the IRB
Columbia students-- Must submit a protocol to Columbia IRB
Researchers from other institutions --Must submit protocols to both Columbia and home IRBs

MVP DATA ACCESS REQUIREMENTS

After MVP releases official reports for each village, Type I and II data will be available upon request to qualified researchers. (This is expected to be no earlier than one year after each round of data collection). Type III data, including MDG indicators constructed according to official United Nations guidelines, will be published for each village on the project's Web site. Income quartiles within each village are one example of such an MDG indicator. MVP reports will also be made available to the general public.

Request Procedures for Type I and II data
1. Data Access
For Type 1 and 2 Data

 All requests for data access must include the following:

a) A list of the requested dataset(s) including titles and/or identification codes

b) Evidence of human subjects training and certification, or equivalent.  Requests will be granted only to individuals who have taken an Institutional Review Board (IRB) human subjects training course and passed the appropriate exam, or who have taken an equivalent substitute training and exam where access to IRB resources is not available.

c) An abstract of 500 words or less summarizing the core hypotheses, methods, and significance of the proposed research.

d) A research proposal of 3 pages or less describing the proposed research, including personnel involved, hypotheses to be tested, methods to be used, time frame of the work, publication plans, and significance of the work.

e) A Data Management Plan, which must describe the procedures that will be followed to safeguard against unauthorized access to the data, and to destroy the data following the completion of the research. Data Users are referred to the companion document to this policy, entitled 'Instructions for Preparing Your MVP Data Management Plan,' which describes the expected components of such a plan and the types of protection expected by the project.

f) If Type 1 data are requested, a statement explaining why these potentially sensitive data are needed for the proposed research.

g) For researchers not included on the MV Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocol, IRB Approval for Research on Human Subjects, which provides evidence of an approved human subjects protocol that has been reviewed and issued by the Data User's home IRB and by the IRB at Columbia University for use of each dataset that has been requested.

Individuals requesting data will be notified of the Committee's decision via email. The Committee will approve the request, ask for a revision, or reject it.   Requests for Type 1 data will receive additional levels of review and oversight.

If the request is approved, the Data Users must register online with the MVP and sign the Data Use Agreement. Upon registration and receipt of consent forms, the Data User will be sent a user name and password, granting access to the requested data from a secure portal on the MVP Web site. (This site is distinct from the MV Data Quality Assurance System (MVDQAS) system used to transfer files for quality assurance purposes before direct identifiers are removed from the datasets.)

Denied requests may be appealed upon request.

2. Permission to Publish
For Type I and II data:
In order to ensure that confidential data are not disclosed, final drafts of any material intended for public dissemination using MVP data must be approved by MVP. Researchers will be notified of the decision via email.

MVP will only deny requests to publicly disseminate material on the grounds that it could jeopardize the confidentiality of participant data. If a request is denied, MVP may suggest revisions to the documents intended for publication to protect the identities of project participants.

DATA USE AGREEMENTS

Type 1 and 2 Data Use Agreement

Definitions
"Data Set" -- Digital data and associated metadata derived from survey instruments and baseline measurements taken at each research village, collected by Survey Enumerators, entered by Data Entry clerks and managed by on-site Database Managers and Science Coordinators.  Qualitative data sets are those collected by core M &amp; E project staff at each research village.  Transcription and coding of these data are conducted and managed by M &amp; E qualitative research team. Economic costing data are collected at each research village by core M &amp; E project staff, on-site Sector Coordinators, and on-site Finance Managers. Costing data are managed by the M &amp; E costing team.

"Data User" - Individual to whom access to one or more Data Sets has been granted, including the partners, institutions, students and staff with whom the Data User collaborates, to whom access must also be granted in order to fulfill the Data User's intended use of the Data Set.

Conditions of Use
1. Acceptable Use
Data Sets may be used solely for the purposes stated in the Data User's original data request. If the Data User later wishes to use the data for a research project different from the one outlined in the original research proposal, a new proposal must be submitted. 'Different' projects wouldinclude those involving significantly different methods, research questions, and integration with other data.

Data Sets may not be used for investigation of specific individuals or organizations. It is understood that some portions of the dataset may be withheld or statistically altered to protect participant confidentiality.

No attempt shall be made to discover the identity of any individual participating in the project. If identities are discovered inadvertently, the identity of any person, household, or institution shall not be disclosed. Users will secure MVP electronic datasets in their possession according to the terms specified in their data management plan, which at a minimum must include the following provisions:

          The version description should contain a version number followed by a version label. We recommend that larger series be defined by a number to the left of a decimal and iterations of the same series by a sequential number that identifies the release. The larger series should be described as (0) cleaned dataset with identifiers for internal use by the MVP for IRB pre-authorized use only (i.e. quality assurance team: database managers, enumerators, data entry clerk, NY data team); (1) cleaned dataset, de-identified, for internal use by approved MVP researchers; and (2) cleaned dataset, de-identified, and prepared for external use by approved researchers.
Examples:
&#8226; v0.1:  Cleaned data with identifiers, first version.
&#8226; v1.2:  Cleaned and de-identified data, second version, for internal use by approved MVP researchers.
&#8226; v2.1: Cleaned and de-identified data, for external use by approved researchers.

          The version description should contain a version number followed by a version label. We recommend that larger series be defined by a number to the left of a decimal and iterations of the same series by a sequential number that identifies the release. The larger series should be described as (0) cleaned dataset with identifiers for internal use by the MVP for IRB pre-authorized use only (i.e. quality assurance team: database managers, enumerators, data entry clerk, NY data team); (1) cleaned dataset, de-identified, for internal use by approved MVP researchers; and (2) cleaned dataset, de-identified, and prepared for external use by approved researchers.
Examples:
&#8226; v0.1:  Cleaned data with identifiers, first version.
&#8226; v1.2:  Cleaned and de-identified data, second version, for internal use by approved MVP researchers.
&#8226; v2.1: Cleaned and de-identified data, for external use by approved researchers.
A brief description of the version should follow the numerical identification.
